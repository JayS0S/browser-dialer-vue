    ## What Does This Thing Do?

    This application allows you to make a call from your browser. It has the
    following main features:

    1. You can mute/unmute your audio.
    1. Send DTMF touch tones by pressing the key pad.

    This tutorial highlights the key bits of code that make this application
    work. [Check out the project README on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/browser-dialer-vue)
    to see how to run the code yourself.

    Let's get started.

    ## Generate a Capability Token

    The Twilio.js Client requires a capability token to work. The capability
    token give our browser an identity and grant it privileges to make an
    outbound call.

    We use the [Twilio Node Helper Library](//www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node)
    to generate and configure our capability token.
    We have to configure a capability token with the SID of a Twilio
    Application to allow outgoing calls.
